# LisasAssets
## "The ultimate assets for alpha seekers."

Lisa’s Assets is a revolutionary crypto analysis platform powered by a squad of AI agents operating within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). These agents deliver unparalleled insights into Web3 projects, using the Lisa Coefficient to evaluate risk, potential, and market trends.

Whether you're an investor, builder, or enthusiast, Lisa’s Assets provides everything you need to make data-driven decisions—and look good doing it.

## Core Features

The Lisa Coefficient: A definitive 1–10 scoring system based on metrics like market cap, tokenomics, code quality, and risk assessment.

## AI Agent Squad: Each agent specializes in a specific domain, from smart contract audits to social sentiment analysis.

Staking Rewards: Earn rewards by staking $LISA tokens, supported by fees from one-off users.
High-Scoring Alerts: Stakers get exclusive email alerts when 9-10 projects are flagged by RiskEye.

# The AI Agents

    MavenMetrics 🧮: Market analyst extraordinaire.
    TokenLogic 📊: Your tokenomics guru.
    CodeCrafter 👨‍💻: The ultimate code enforcer.
    HypePulse 🔥: Tracks social sentiment and hype trends.
    TruthSeeker 🔍: Investigates teams, partnerships, and transparency.
    LiquidEdge 💧: Specializes in liquidity and trading flows.
    RiskEye ⚠️: The leader, integrating all data to deliver the Lisa Coefficient.

## How It Works

    User Requests Analysis:
        Non-stakers pay $10 (placeholder fee) for a one-off project review.
        Stakers enjoy unlimited searches (fair usage applied).

    Agents Get to Work:
        Each agent analyzes specific aspects of the project.
        RiskEye synthesizes all findings into a Lisa Coefficient score.

    Results Delivered:
        Users receive a detailed report via the Lisa’s Assets dashboard.
        Stakers are notified of high-potential projects (9–10 scores).
